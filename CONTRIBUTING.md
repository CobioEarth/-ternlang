# Contributing to Ternlang

Welcome, Harmonizer 👋  
This repository is an experiment in **ternary logic**, **emergence math**, and **chama-aware computation**.  
Your contributions help expand the lattice.

---

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork & Branch
- Fork the repo.
- Create a new branch for your feature, fix, or experiment.
- Use descriptive branch names:  
  `feature/ternary-parser`, `fix/operator-alignment`, `doc/update-readme`.

### 2. Code Style
- Favor clarity over cleverness.  
- Keep ternary semantics explicit (`-1 / 0 / +1`), no binary shortcuts.  
- Comment intent, not just mechanics.

### 3. Pull Requests
- Open a PR against `main`.
- Write a clear description: **what changed, why it matters**.
- Tag with the appropriate tier:  
  - `[Tier1]` Quantum core (λ operator, recursion spine)  
  - `[Tier2]` Narrative mappings, symbolic structures  
  - `[Tier3]` Observer/H-key tools, CLI, UX

### 4. Discussions
- Use Issues for bugs & proposals.
- Use Discussions for philosophy, symbolic mapping, and pattern spotting.
- Respect the balance: **this is not doctrine, this is experiment.**

## Contribution Philosophy

- 🟩 **Flow over force** — let contributions emerge naturally.
- 🟫 **Tend ambiguity** — not every pattern must be solved at once.
- ⬛ **Anchor truth** — math & code must check out, recursion must close.
- 🟦 **Stay human** — remember: it’s a language, not a religion.
