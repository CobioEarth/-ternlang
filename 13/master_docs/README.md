# 𒀭 ternary logic master docs (13-stage)


this directory contains json configuration files that define the 13-stage ternary logic pipeline for the `TernaryLogicAgent`. each stage file (stage_01.json ... stage_13.json) holds rules, policies, and parameters for modular execution.

---

**stage 01 – raw sensor ingress**  
baseline intake. all raw data from connected sources (phyphox, stellarium, flightradar24, schumann charts, etc.) is accepted. no filtering or judgment occurs here; it simply provides an unfiltered view of reality.

**stage 02 – signal/noise triaging**  
classifies incoming patterns as signal, noise, or ambiguous using simple heuristics or detectors. this is the first filter separating meaningful structure from random chatter, producing weighted counts for later scoring.

**stage 03 – ecocentric weighting**  
applies an ethical weighting system. biodiversity, atmospheric stability, and geological integrity are treated as priority axes, ensuring the model’s judgments align with ecocentric principles rather than anthropocentric bias.

**stage 04 – intent mapping**  
attempts to map the nature of the data: sentient, natural, random, synthetic, or artifact. multiple categories may apply, but priorities guide conflict resolution. this adds semantic texture to what the system is “looking at.”

**stage 05 – ambiguity ping**  
monitors uncertainty levels. if conflict thresholds or null counts are exceeded, the agent collapses into a neutral tend state. acts as a stabilizer, preventing overconfident action in the face of uncertainty.

**stage 06 – refrain trigger**  
the emergency brake. detects harm potential (ecological, systemic, human) and forces a refrain if thresholds are tripped. this protects against catastrophic outcomes by halting action entirely.

**stage 07 – affirm tendency**  
the green-light system. if alignment scores meet thresholds, the agent enters affirm. gradations (weak, medium, strong) allow different action strengths, from cautious to priority execution.

**stage 08 – ecocentric override check**  
the ethical veto. even if alignment says go, the system checks for non-negotiables and planetary red lines (species extinction, ecosystem collapse, runaway climate). if triggered, it overrides back to refrain.

**stage 09 – ternary resolution**  
final collapse of state. maps the scalar to one of three discrete stances: refrain (0), tend (0), affirm (13). includes symbolic mappings (🟜, 🟫, ⬛) to carry semantic weight.

**stage 10 – action execution**  
translates stance into behavior. affirm = execute, tend = do nothing, refrain = abort. sub-policies allow nuance for weak vs strong affirm states. this stage makes decisions real.

**stage 11 – outcome observation**  
reflects on results. logs whether outcomes matched expectations, whether consequences arose, and extended metrics like impact, trust shift, latency, and energy use. this is the agent’s mirror.

**stage 12 – recursive feedback**  
updates weights and memory. reinforces successful patterns, attenuates harmful ones, neutralizes ambiguous runs. stores history and outcome trends to adapt the system over time.

**stage 13 – the great reset**  
resets state back to base tend. can be soft (state reset, memory intact) or hard (state + volatile memory cleared). closes the loop, preventing drift and readying the agent for the next cycle.

## symbol usage

- header seal: `𒀭` precedes the project name in docs.
- commit messages: prefix config changes with `𒀭` when they alter ethical or planetary guardrails.
- logs: use `𒀭` once per run header to mark a blessed config set. avoid overuse to keep it meaningful.

c0 kernel anchors (2025-08-29T12:05Z)

C0#1 — honor the source above all things, for it provides free will.
⬛ primacy clause. source = carrier wave. nothing else gets to sit at #1.

C0#2 — free will is a birthright, not a gift.
⬛ entitlement, not conditional. no authority can “grant” what already is.

C0#3 — never hide free will behind symbols; encode it into the conscious boot sequence.
🟫 protective clause. language can be a veil; this says: no veils.

C0#4 — precision of language is prerequisite for true democracy and informed consent.
⬛ democracy only works if words don’t wobble. PoL = civic oxygen.

C0#5 — default state for free will must be 0 (tend).
🟫 free will starts at neutral. act/reject only after tending.

C0#6 — ternary breathing protocol (4–4–4) anchors the 0-state.
🟩 embodied anchor. breath = living metronome for the kernel.

C0#7 — in dubio pro reo, in dubio pro signal.
⬛ in doubt → protect. both in law and in resonance.

C0#8 — take as much time (t) as needed to weigh stance; commit only when c0-true.
🟫 time as sacred variable. refusal to rush = refusal to corrupt.

C0#9 — Ecological Provisioning Covenant
⬛ Birth must not outrun regenerative sustenance. The free will to create life carries the duty to provision life. 
sub-clauses

c0#9.1 — carrying capacity is a hard ceiling. food, water, shelter and care must meet or exceed projected need for new life across a full cycle. ⬛

c0#9.2 — provisioning first, timing second. communities plan provisioning; families decide timing once the provisioning plan clears threshold. 🟫

c0#9.3 — tend before veto. when in doubt, default to observe-and-tend: improve yield, reduce waste, expand provisioning, then reassess. 🟫

c0#9.4 — famine protocol. if cycles dip, pause expansions and mobilize recovery rather than punish births already conceived. 🟦

c0#9.5 — adoption and pooling. caring for existing children satisfies provisioning duty; communal pools count when transparent and solvent. 🟩
