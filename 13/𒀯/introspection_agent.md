the introspection engine ‚Äî stage-4 scaffold

üü¶ objective
turn passive logs into self-analysis that proposes safe, reversible tweaks. diary ‚Üí analyst. still human-governed. still deterministic.

üü© architecture at a glance

reader: incremental pass over the jsonl chain using a cursor, so we never reprocess old records

extractors: fold events into rolling windows and counters

detectors: small, testable rules that spot ‚Äúwhy‚Äù patterns

proposer: drafts parameter changes and a dry-run plan

simulator: replays the last N hours against the proposed change

governor: records the analysis, blocks or applies the change behind a canary flag

pillar hooks: every introspection and decision is itself chained for audit

1) reader: incremental scan with continuity üü¶

keep introspection.cursor file storing last processed digest

on start, follow the chain from that digest forward

write an introspection_checkpoint record back into the chain so auditors can reconstruct exactly what you saw

class ChainCursor:
    def __init__(self, path, cursor_path=".introspection.cursor"):
        self.path = path
        self.cursor_path = cursor_path
        self.head = self._load()

    def _load(self):
        try:
            return open(self.cursor_path).read().strip() or None
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return None

    def save(self, digest: str):
        with open(self.cursor_path, "w") as f:
            f.write(digest + "\n")

2) extractors: light features from diary üü©

maintain rolling stats in RAM (and persist snapshots hourly so restart is cheap):

event_rate_hz per 5-min window

score distribution p50/p95 per window

override_rate: fraction of human resolutions that contradicted model state

fp_loop_index: repeated ‚ÄúVULNERABLE‚ÜíOBJECT‚Äù on similar payload bands

debounce_hit_ratio: alerts suppressed due to debounce vs issued

temp_mismatch: correlation of high temperature with rising false positives

signature_sketch: coarse buckets from _masked() bins to spot repeated shapes without PII

3) detectors: tiny rules that ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù üü´

each detector is a pure function window -> Finding.

D1 rate-drift: if event_rate_hz z-score ‚â• 3 for 2 windows, flag ‚Äúingress regime shift.‚Äù

D2 false-positive loop: if the same signature_sketch recurs ‚â• K times and ‚â• 70% were overruled by humans, flag ‚Äústale heuristic.‚Äù

D3 debounce inefficiency: if debounce_hit_ratio > 0.7 while CRITICAL count stays flat, propose longer vulnerable debounce; if critical bursts slip through, propose shorter.

D4 temperature-misaligned thresholds: if negative temperature correlates with rising overrides, propose nudging CFG_LO/CFG_HI up a hair to cut noise; reverse if positive temp correlates with misses.

D5 resolver quality: if a specific resolver source produces many timeouts then OBJECT, propose removing OBSERVE from that resolver entirely or lowering the timeout just for that source.

every finding emits an introspection_finding record to the chain with evidence hashes and window bounds.

4) proposer: safe, reversible nudges üü¶

turn findings into parameter deltas with caps and cooldowns.

thresholds: clamp nudges at ¬±0.01 per day

debounce: ¬±10% per day with floor/ceiling you already enforce

resolver policy: switch default to ¬±1 bias under pressure

temperature Œ±: nudge smoothing alpha by ¬±0.05 if oscillations detected

proposal schema (chained):

{
  "kind": "introspection_proposal",
  "payload": {
    "proposal_id": "uuid",
    "ts": "RFC3339",
    "target": "effective_hi",
    "current": 0.75,
    "proposed": 0.74,
    "reason": "D2:false_positive_loop",
    "window": {"start":"...","end":"..."},
    "evidence": ["digest_a","digest_b"],
    "dry_run_plan": {"lookback_h":"24","metric":"override_rate"},
    "canary": {"enabled": true, "fraction": 0.1, "duration_min": 60}
  }
}

5) simulator: dry-run before any change üü©

replay last 24h of event and classify records with the new parameter in memory

recompute states and count: false positives, alerts issued, resolver timeouts

only promote if improvement ‚â• guardrail (eg 20% fewer overrides with ‚â§5% more misses)

emit introspection_simulation with before/after deltas and a decision: approve, reject, needs human signoff.

6) governor: apply, canary, revert üüß

on approve, write introspection_apply with the exact parameter and a revert_by timestamp

flip the parameter in a runtime overlay object that TernaryServerFirewall reads before using config values

route 10% of traffic to ‚Äúcanary params‚Äù for 60 minutes

if failure metrics trip, auto-revert and log introspection_revert with cause

after canary, promote to global and persist the new baseline in a small firewall.params.json with its own HMAC and key_id

7) pillar integration: treat introspection like incidents ‚¨õ

when a proposal is applied or rejected, log a handshake with ‚Äúwhat was learned‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat to do better‚Äù

this keeps the introspection itself accountable to the same audit ritual

minimal wiring in your code
A) add a runtime overlay for parameters

no code surgery. one accessor.

class ParamOverlay:
    def __init__(self):
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
        self._vals = {}

    def get(self, name, default): 
        with self._lock:
            return self._vals.get(name, default)

    def set(self, name, value):
        with self._lock:
            self._vals[name] = value

PARAMS = ParamOverlay()


use it where you compute thresholds and debounce:

base_hi = PARAMS.get("CFG_HI", CFG_HI)
base_lo = PARAMS.get("CFG_LO", CFG_LO)
base_v  = PARAMS.get("CFG_DEBOUNCE_SEC_V", CFG_DEBOUNCE_SEC_V)
base_c  = PARAMS.get("CFG_DEBOUNCE_SEC_C", CFG_DEBOUNCE_SEC_C)

B) a tiny IntrospectionEngine skeleton

runs hourly in a thread. reads chain, emits findings, simulates, proposes canary changes, logs everything back.

class IntrospectionEngine(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, chain_path, sink, interval_s=3600):
        super().__init__(daemon=True)
        self.chain = chain_path
        self.sink = sink
        self.interval_s = interval_s
        self.cursor = ChainCursor(chain_path)
        self.stop = threading.Event()

    def run(self):
        while not self.stop.is_set():
            try:
                findings = self._scan_and_detect()
                for f in findings:
                    self._append("introspection_finding", f)
                    prop = self._propose(f)
                    if not prop: 
                        continue
                    self._append("introspection_proposal", prop)
                    sim = self._simulate(prop)
                    self._append("introspection_simulation", sim)
                    if sim["decision"] == "approve":
                        self._apply_canary(prop)
                self._checkpoint()
            except Exception as e:
                self._append("introspection_error", {"err": str(e)})
            self.stop.wait(self.interval_s)

C) safe apply with canary

set overlay values for a fraction of flows keyed by event_id hash modulo 10, else use baseline. log apply and eventual promote or revert.

guardrails so this stays sane

caps + cooldowns: never more than one nudge per parameter per day

bounded scope: only operational numerics at first: thresholds, debounce, alpha, resolver timeout

human veto: any ‚Äúapprove‚Äù that crosses a big impact threshold gets a required human ACK

keyed evidence: every decision cites digest ids so an auditor can reconstruct the exact dataset

what this buys you

your sentinel stops being a stenographer and becomes a reflective operator

every ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is backed by repeatable math and replay, not vibes

you keep the chain of custody. every self-change is itself audited

üü® picking the first anomaly to teach it

my short list, ordered by signal clarity and safety:

false-positive loop on a repeating signature
cheapest win, lowest risk. if humans keep overruling the same masked band, nudge lo upward by 0.01 after a successful 24h dry-run.

debounce inefficiency under quiet conditions
high debounce suppressions without critical events. propose +10% vulnerable debounce. canary for 60 minutes.

resolver timeout storm
if many decisions default to OBJECT due to timeouts, lower CFG_RESOLVER_TIMEOUT by 20% and remove OBSERVE from that resolver‚Äôs random path. monitor override rate.

my vote to start is false-positive loop. it teaches the engine the full lifecycle: detect ‚Üí propose ‚Üí simulate ‚Üí canary ‚Üí handshake.
