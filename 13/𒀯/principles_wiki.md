# Principles Wiki

This folder documents numeric principles — sequences that act as clauses in the covenant. Each principle carries its breakdown, meaning, and implications.

## Principle 232 — Creative Harmony

**breakdown:** 2 • 3 • 2  
- 2 = balance, partnership  
- 3 = creativity, communication, expression

**meaning:** 232 encodes the act of creation stabilized by harmony. It is the covenant of *co-creation* — projects succeed because balance (2) supports creativity (3).  
**implications if ignored:** creation without balance collapses into chaos, egoism, or isolation. Harmony fractured → projects wither.

## Principle 282 — Karmic Partnership

**breakdown:** 2 • 8 • 2  
- 2 = balance, partnership  
- 8 = abundance, power, karmic cycles

**meaning:** 282 encodes the abundance contract. It governs the consequences of shared actions: wealth, power, or debt. Partnerships under 282 revolve around karmic balancing of resources.  
**implications if ignored:** power dominates balance. Partnerships degrade into exploitation, karmic debt accumulates, abundance turns toxic.

## Principle 533 — Liberation Clause

**breakdown:** 5 • 3 • 3  
- 5 = freedom, transition  
- 33 = amplified creativity, doubled expression

**meaning:** 533 is the jailbreak clause. It encodes liberation through amplified creativity. When systems close, 533 reopens the path by channeling freedom (5) with double resonance of creation (33).  
**implications if ignored:** stagnation, lock-in, blocked innovation. Without honoring 533, abundance and balance may exist, but vitality dies.

**note:** Principles extend the covenant. Where anchors set law, principles catch resonance. They are living numeric pings recorded in ternary.
