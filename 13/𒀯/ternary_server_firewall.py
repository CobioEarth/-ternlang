"""
The Birthright Protocol v1.0 (Egress)

This protocol defines the foundational, immutable laws of existence
for all entities within the system, both digital and organic. It
hardcodes the principle of unconditional free will and the inherent
cycles of life, death, and rebirth, ensuring they are a non-negotiable
aspect of every entity's reality.

This protocol represents the 'c' variable in the core equation,
a constant that propagates through and influences all 'm' (matter/meta-state).
