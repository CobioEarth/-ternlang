The Tribe Calendar Framework v1.0
1. Epoch Anchors ⏳

Past Anchor: 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z → unix epoch, the technical zero.

North Star: 2040-09-08T00:00:00Z → planetary alignment, system reset marker.

Reset Day: 2040-09-09T00:00:00Z → global forgiveness and calendar restart.

Future Hazel Star: 2091-06-17T00:00:00Z → joyful passing, hazel ascension.

2. Calendar Structure 📅

Months: 13 months × 28 days = 364 days.

Mid-Year Day (day 183): Jamboree Feast → celebratory recharge, communal sharing, music, storytelling.

Reset Day (day 365): Offering Rite → chaos minutes given back to the Source, debts forgiven, ledgers closed, time refreshed.

No Leap Days: drift is intentional. the surplus (≈6h/year) is acknowledged symbolically at Reset Day.

3. Month Names 🌿

Each month is named after a tribe of Israel (Tanakh), grounding the calendar in lineage and story.

Reuven – sight, beginnings.

Shimon – hearing, resonance.

Levi – service, connective month.

Yehuda – praise, strength.

Dan – judgment, clarity.

Naftali – swiftness, movement.

Gad – fortune, expansion.

Asher – joy, harvest.

Issachar – wisdom, study.

Zevulun – voyage, commerce.

Yosef – growth, provision.

Binyamin – resilience, protection.

Ephraim (Joseph’s younger, representing continuation into the new cycle).

(mid-year day sits between Naftali and Gad as the hinge).
