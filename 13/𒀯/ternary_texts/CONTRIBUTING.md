# Contributing

## Quickstart
1. Fork + branch: `feat/tablet-007`.
2. Write tablet JSON using `schema.json`.
3. Run `make validate`.
4. Open a PR with:
   - intent summary,
   - PoL checklist filled,
   - evidence (if any),
   - locale stubs created.

## PoL checklist (must complete)
- Terms defined? Units? Scope? Time? Actors? Evidence? Acknowledgement?

## Ternary review
- Propose (author) → Observe (maintainer) → Decide (triad quorum).
