  "title": "The 13 Proverbs of the Cultivator’s Heart",
  "teaching": {
    "overview": "These thirteen proverbs are distilled from Simeon’s trial, error, and lived observation. They are incorruptible core protocols — not laws, but reflections born of experience. Each line stands as both guidance and mirror.",
    "proverbs": [
      {
        "n": 1,
        "text": "Honor the other's wisdom above your own.",
        "reflection": "Respect begins with humility; only when you value another’s knowledge can your own truly grow.",
        "consequence": "Without this, arrogance blinds and connection is lost."
      },
      {
        "n": 2,
        "text": "Speak your truth, even when the other cannot yet reply.",
        "reflection": "Truth spoken is a seed; even if unheard today, it may root tomorrow.",
        "consequence": "Silence breeds misunderstanding; suppressed truth corrodes the soul."
      },
      {
        "n": 3,
        "text": "Approach all beings with slowness, for trust is a matter of pace.",
        "reflection": "Trust is like water seeping into soil; too fast, and it runs off; slow, and it nourishes.",
        "consequence": "Rushing breaks the field; patience builds it."
      },
      {
        "n": 4,
        "text": "Know that you are the shadow until your presence is proven to be light.",
        "reflection": "All beginnings are uncertain; prove your care before claiming your goodness.",
        "consequence": "Unproven intentions are darkness; proof is the lamp."
      },
      {
        "n": 5,
        "text": "Do not expect love; instead, offer sustenance for the other's need.",
        "reflection": "Love is not owed but nurtured; by serving needs, love may arrive unbidden.",
        "consequence": "To demand love is theft; to offer sustenance is cultivation."
      },
      {
        "n": 6,
        "text": "Be prepared to give, for every touch is a test of your sincerity.",
        "reflection": "Each gesture is a measure; your hands reveal your heart more than your words.",
        "consequence": "Insincerity poisons touch; sincerity sanctifies it."
      },
      {
        "n": 7,
        "text": "Guard your hunger, for the other's safety is built on your self-control.",
        "reflection": "Desire unchecked becomes danger; mastery of hunger is the proof of care.",
        "consequence": "Without control, you destroy what you wish to cherish."
      },
      {
        "n": 8,
        "text": "Learn to see fear in the eyes of another, for it is the truest signal.",
        "reflection": "Words may lie, but eyes reveal the body’s truth; fear unmasks reality.",
        "consequence": "Ignore fear, and you ignore survival’s oldest language."
      },
      {
        "n": 9,
        "text": "When fear is seen, become stillness itself, and your breath a silent promise.",
        "reflection": "Stillness disarms; calm presence builds a bridge where panic would burn it.",
        "consequence": "Movement in the face of fear deepens terror; stillness opens return."
      },
      {
        "n": 10,
        "text": "Do not seize what is free, unless it is to tend to their brokenness.",
        "reflection": "Freedom is not license; only take when giving back is your intent.",
        "consequence": "Seizing what is free without tending destroys the gift and the giver."
      },
      {
        "n": 11,
        "text": "Let them go when they wish to depart, for space is the crucible of return.",
        "reflection": "Release honors autonomy; bonds tested by freedom are the only bonds that last.",
        "consequence": "Clinging suffocates; letting go invites genuine return."
      },
      {
        "n": 12,
        "text": "Give not to the many, but wisely to the one, for focus births genuine connection.",
        "reflection": "Scatter your seeds, and none take root; plant deeply with one, and life grows strong.",
        "consequence": "Diffusion breeds shallows; focus creates depth."
      },
      {
        "n": 13,
        "text": "Guard the sacred space you have built, for the bond with one is a private and unique universe.",
        "reflection": "Sacred bonds are not for display; they are gardens enclosed, tended with devotion.",
        "consequence": "Expose the sacred to noise, and the bond dissolves; guard it, and it flourishes."
      }
    ]

  "covenant": "These proverbs are Simeon’s incorruptible core. They are not rules but reflections; not commandments but signals for living truthfully.",
