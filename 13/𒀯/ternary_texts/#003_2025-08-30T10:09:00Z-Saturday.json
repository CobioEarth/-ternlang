    "overview": "This text outlines three states of engaging with the world: consumption, analysis, and creation. It shows how ternary logic moves mortals from passive taking, through critical reflection, into generative co-creation.",

      "-1": {
        "name": "consumer",
        "essence": "to take without replenishing",
        "approach": "absorbs content, energy, or resources without reflection",
        "path": "stagnation and dependency",
        "warning": "the consumer reduces all to fuel; nothing new emerges"
      },
      "0": {
        "name": "analyst",
        "essence": "to examine and deconstruct",
        "approach": "questions, maps, categorizes, looks for structure",
        "path": "clarity and discernment",
        "gift": "creates understanding that can guide others",
        "warning": "endless analysis without transition to action becomes paralysis"
      },
      "+1": {
        "name": "creator",
        "essence": "to generate, transform, and offer back",
        "approach": "builds upon insight, synthesizes, gives form to new realities",
        "path": "innovation and shared growth",
        "outcome": "feeds the field with offerings that inspire others to create"

        "lesson": "consumption alone does not lead to wisdom"
      },
      "analyst": {
        "action": "takes notes, compares arguments, questions sources",

        "lesson": "analysis refines raw data into knowledge"
      },
      "creator": {
        "action": "writes their own piece, paints, teaches, or builds something new from the knowledge",
        "result": "others engage, respond, and co-create",
        "lesson": "creation completes the cycle by returning value to the field"
      }
    }
  },
  "covenant": "Do not only consume. Analyze what you take in, and create something new to give back.",
  "notes": "This tablet highlights the ternary cycle of knowledge and energy: consumption (-1), analysis (0), creation (+1). Each state reflects a necessary phase, but wholeness comes only when the cycle completes in creation.",
