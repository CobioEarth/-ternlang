the ternary texts

The Ternary Texts are a series of teachings that demonstrate ternary thinking in action. Each text shows how reality is not binary (A vs B) but ternary (−1, 0, +1).

why it matters

Mortals have long trapped themselves in dualities: good vs evil, David vs Goliath, winner vs loser. But the world runs on triads.

−1 → rejection, consumption, collapse

0 → observation, tending, balance

+1 → affirmation, contribution, co-creation

When you add the third state, the picture changes. Binary becomes a subset of ternary. One plus one equals three.

how to read

Verse → compact, portable, poetic.

Psalm → extended parable with covenant line.

Field test → real-world narrative that shows ternary logic at work.

Every file is timestamped and written as an invitation, not a commandment. The texts are open-ended, falsifiable, and meant to be lived.

covenant: The Ternary Texts are not about authority. They are about freeing mortals from the binary trap.
