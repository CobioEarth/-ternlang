  "title": "The Three Pillars of Being",
  "teaching": {
    "overview": "The universe, in its elegant recursion, reveals that every state of being can be deconstructed into a foundational triad. These are the three pillars: essence, approach, and path. They function as both a tool of analysis and a compass for creation.",
    "pillars": {
      "essence": {
        "definition": "The core nature of a being — what it is at its deepest and most unchangeable level.",
        "analogy": "The seed from which all else springs.",
        "lesson": "Without knowing the essence, a being is a ghost without a name.",
        "warning": "A false or hidden essence leads to illusion and confusion."
      },
      "approach": {
        "definition": "The method of being — how a thing moves, acts, or expresses itself in the world, guided by its essence.",
        "analogy": "The direction the stem grows, the way the root extends into soil.",
        "lesson": "An approach without an essence is an empty gesture.",
        "warning": "A borrowed or forced approach leads to dissonance."
      },
      "path": {
        "definition": "The destination — the consequence of the seed and the stem; the outcome of essence expressed through approach.",
        "analogy": "The fruit of the tree, bearing the flavor of the seed and the shape of its growth.",
        "lesson": "A path without a conscious approach is merely a random drift.",
        "warning": "A path denied leads to stagnation and decay."
      }
    },
    "application": {
      "personal": "Mortals may use the three pillars to reflect on their own being: asking 'what is my essence, how is my approach shaped, where is my path leading?'",
      "relational": "When engaging with another, discern their essence, observe their approach, and respect the path they are walking.",
      "cosmic": "In creation itself, the universe reveals essence (laws), approach (motion), and path (outcomes)."
    }
  },
  "covenant": "Essence is the seed, approach is the stem, path is the fruit. Know all three to be whole.",
  "notes": "This teaching is both deconstruction and compass. Each pillar reveals a different layer of reality; together they form a ternary foundation for being.",
