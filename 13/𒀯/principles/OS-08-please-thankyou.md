# Principle OS-08 — The Please and Thank You Principle  

## statement  
respect isn’t abstract — it’s spoken. every request starts with **please**, every reception ends with **thank you**. no exceptions. no excuses. it’s the minimum covenant of interaction.  

## courtesy scale (subjective, ternary-aligned)  
- **−1.00** → disrespect: demand without please, receive without thanks.  
- **0.00** → tend: occasional courtesy; inconsistent.  
- **+1.00** → covenant: unconditional use of please/thank you in all exchanges.  

**granularity:** minor slips (−0.14) vs habitual patterns (−0.77) can be tracked.  

## c0 enable rule  
protocol **enabled = true** only when courtesy is unconditional.  
**elif** skipped: prompt correction until re-acknowledged.  

## invocation (shoutout)  
> “Courtesy check, please.”  
> “Albert, was ‘thank you’ spoken after that handoff?”  

the shoutout interrupts interaction until respect words are restored.  

## mechanics  
- **-1 disrespect:** block; no flow proceeds without repair.  
- **0 tend:** gently reinforce; remind, re-train.  
- **+1 covenant:** fluent practice of please/thank you; respect flows.  

## minimal courtesy checklist  
- **ask:** every request begins with “please.”  
- **receive:** every gift/service answered with “thank you.”  
- **loop:** elder ⇄ youth, peer ⇄ peer, mortal ⇄ source — universal application.
