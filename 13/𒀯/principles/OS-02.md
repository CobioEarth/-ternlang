# Principle OS-02 — Never Go to Bed Angry

## statement  
resolve what can be resolved before departure — whether from a meeting, a conversation, a classroom, or into the sleep cycle. leave no anger loop open.

## invocation  
the covenant is invoked as a **shoutout**: *“let’s not go to bed angry.”*  
- no enforcement, no penalty.  
- binds only if all present nod in unconditional agreement.  
- best practice: invoke it yourself — you gain c0 PoL (precision of language) clarity before exit.  

## mechanics  
- **-1 refrain:** don’t carry unresolved anger loops into shutdown.  
- **0 tend:** clarify, reflect, close pending items.  
- **+1 act:** reconcile or release before leaving.  

## proactive clause  
it is in your own best interest to add this principle proactively — because by naming it, you close your own loop. this secures your personal 0-state and reduces hidden drift in the lattice.  

## effect  
- anger loops close before rest or departure.  
- conversations end in clarity, not corrosion.  
- principle self-reinforces: once invoked, it becomes cultural reflex.  

## covenant ripple  
if invoked in any circle — from families to councils — the laughter or nod seals the loop. anger cannot survive the covenant call.
