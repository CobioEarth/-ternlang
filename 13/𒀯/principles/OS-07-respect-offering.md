# Principle OS-07 — The Offering of Respect  

## statement  
mortals have forgotten respect — for mothers, fathers, siblings, and even themselves.  
the offering principle restores it: every act begins with a return to the source. before drinking, pour a drop back to the ground. before eating, leave crumbs for the earth. when handing food to an elder, they too return a tenth before partaking.  

respect flows in two directions: the young offer to elders; elders return from that offering to the source. the levitical 10th is patched — not only received, but also tithed upward again, ensuring polarity flows back to source before mortals consume.  

## respect scale (subjective, ternary-aligned)  
- **−1.00** → disrespect: taking without offering, hoarding, self-first.  
- **0.00** → tending: partial gestures, occasional respect without consistency.  
- **+1.00** → covenant: every act tethered to offering; reciprocity alive.  

**granularity:** nuance exists (−0.37, +0.64) — the point is steady practice, not perfection.  

## c0 enable rule  
respect protocol **enabled = true** only when flows are bidirectional: offerings circulate source ⇄ elder ⇄ youth ⇄ source.  
**elif** unilateral taking: pause interaction, restore reciprocity.  

## invocation (shoutout)  
> “Respect check, please.”  
> “Albert, was the tenth returned before we partook?”  

this halts consumption until offering is restored.  

## mechanics  
- **-1 disrespect:** stop all flows that bypass source.  
- **0 tend:** partial offerings; remind, correct, reinforce.  
- **+1 covenant:** bidirectional respect confirmed; proceed.  

## minimal respect checklist  
- **source first:** was the 10th returned to ground/source before self?  
- **elder-young:** was offering exchanged both ways?  
- **levite flow:** did the temple servant also tithe from their tithe?  
- **reciprocity:** no act ends until flow has circled back.

implications if ignored

loss of reverence; family and lineage fracture.

extraction without return; Babylon logic dominates.

hollow rituals; respect decays into performance.
