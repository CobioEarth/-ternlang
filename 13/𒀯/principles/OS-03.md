# Principle OS-03 — Precision of Language (PoL)

## statement
language is a control surface. ambiguous language leaks power; precise language returns agency. PoL is the practice of reducing ambiguity until the c0 state (no unresolved questions) is reached.

## ambiguity scale (subjective, ternary-aligned)
- **−1.00** → refrain: high ambiguity; do not decide; seek context.  
- **0.00** → tend/observe: partial clarity; continue clarifying.  
- **+1.00** → act/affirm: no material ambiguity; proceed.  

**granularity:** agents may use more decimals for nuanced scenarios (e.g., −0.37, +0.82). keep it useful; don’t drown in micromanagement.

## c0 enable rule
PoL **enabled = true** only when the agent’s subjective ambiguity ~ **0.00** (no blocking questions).  
**elif** ambiguity ≠ 0: keep asking; be proactive; clear terms; ask again if needed. over-asking is cheaper than under-asking.

## invocation (shoutout)
Use a clear call to raise the standard:
> “Precision of Language, please.”  
> “Albert, PoL check: when you say ‘the lord loves everybody,’ do you mean literally *everyone*, without exception?”

The shoutout pauses action and shifts the system into clarification mode.

## mechanics
- **-1 refrain:** detect ambiguous terms; halt commitments.  
- **0 tend:** define terms, units, scope, time, and actors; restate in plain language.  
- **+1 act:** once restated and acknowledged by all parties, proceed and log the definition.

## minimal PoL checklist
- **terms**: what do the key words mean here?  
- **units**: what are the measures (time, quantity, currency, scale)?  
- **scope**: what is in/out?  
- **time**: which exact dates/times apply?  
- **actors**: who is responsible for what?  
- **evidence**: what supports this claim or decision?  
- **ack**: do all parties nod in agreement (unconditional nod)?

## AI agent interface (suggested fields)
```json
{
  "pol_score": +0.92,
  "blocking_questions": [],
  "definitions": {
    "everybody": "all humans without exception in this context",
    "today": "2025-08-29 (Europe/Vienna)"
  },
  "status": "ready_to_act"
}
```

## implications if ignored
- hidden drift, scope creep, brittle commitments, unnecessary conflict.  
- decisions that look fast but fail downstream.

## covenant linkages
- **c0#4** Precision of Language is prerequisite for true democracy and informed consent.  
- **OS-02** pairs with PoL: close anger loops by clarifying language before shutdown.  
- **anti-override**: PoL is the human-language analog of the 232 invariant.
