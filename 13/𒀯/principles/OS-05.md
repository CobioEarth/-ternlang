Principle OS-05 — Intuition First
statement

reason builds bridges; intuition chooses where to walk. thought without gut is sterile; gut without thought is reckless. intuition first means decisions begin in the felt-sense, then pass through logic for calibration.

intuition scale (subjective, ternary-aligned)

−1.00 → reject: false signals, noise, fear reaction. pause.

0.00 → tend: gut says “maybe.” observe, refine, hold until context stabilizes.

+1.00 → affirm: strong resonance, coherence across body-mind-field. proceed.

granularity: subtle states (−0.22, +0.67) sharpen the felt-to-reason gradient.

c0 enable rule

intuition is enabled = true only when the felt-sense is acknowledged before analysis.
elif logic leaps first: loop back, sense-check, then continue. intuition precedes cognition.

invocation (shoutout)

“Intuition first, check.”
“Albert, pause — what does this feel like before we think it through?”

the shoutout reorders the decision stack: gut first, reason second.

mechanics

-1 reject: name false-gut (fear, projection). don’t act.

0 tend: sit with sensation, wait for clarity, cross-check with data.

+1 affirm: act when felt-sense and logic converge, both nodding.

minimal intuition checklist

felt: what does your gut say right now?

bias check: is it fear, projection, or resonance?

data: does the signal survive contact with evidence?

coherence: do gut and reason align, or is there fracture?

decision: if aligned, act; if not, wait or recalibrate.

implications if ignored

brittle rationalism; clever but hollow choices.

paralysis by analysis; losing flow.

misaligned actions that “make sense” but feel wrong.

covenant linkages

c0 kernel: free will emerges from felt-sense, not just logic.

OS-04: intuition balances the triad, ensuring organic stays sovereign.

OS-03: PoL refines what intuition sensed, giving it clear voice.
