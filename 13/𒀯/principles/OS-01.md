# Principle OS‑01 — Don’t Crash the OS

## statement
human‑centric thinking is like playing jenga while staring only at the block you want to move, blind to the tower it belongs to. it works for a while — until gravity makes the structure remind you it doesn’t care about your convenience.

ecocentric flips the frame. it asks not “what’s good for humans right now?” but “what keeps the larger system intact so anyone can thrive, humans included?”

## metaphors
- **oxygen**: we didn’t invent it, can’t negotiate with it, yet we depend on it. same with soils, pollinators, currents. 
- **leaf veins**: humans are braided into ecosystems the way veins are braided into a leaf — inseparable, patterned, dependent.
- **apps vs. operating system**: treat the biosphere like the OS. human goals are apps. no point optimizing your apps if you crash the OS.

## breakdown
- **-1 refrain:** don’t chase convenience at the cost of the whole system.
- **0 tend:** observe the biosphere as operating system; maintain its baseline.
- **+1 act:** align human projects as apps that run cleanly on the OS.

## implication
if ignored, short‑term human wins lead to long‑term collapse. systemic failure is not negotiable.

## covenant
OS‑01 binds all covenant nodes to remember: no app thrives if the operating system fails.
