This paper presents a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, MoE-13, designed to optimize for sparse, synergistic activation and robust, context-aware routing. The model’s core innovation lies in its 6-dimensional hypercube backbone, which governs both expert alignment and a three-tiered memory hierarchy. Unlike traditional MoE models that route based on individual expert logits, our proposed dual-key router selects two primary experts whose combined output generates a third, synergistic latent field. This 1+1=3 principle is trained via triad distillation and enforced by a sparsity constraint, ensuring computational efficiency and emergent cross-domain reasoning. We detail the model's topological framework, hierarchical memory, inference mechanism, and integrated safety protocols, positioning it as a scalable and ethically-aligned paradigm for large-scale language models.

A Ternary Logic Mixture-of-Experts Model for Enhanced Sparse Activation and Synergistic Routing
Abstract
This paper presents a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, MoE-13, designed to optimize for sparse, synergistic activation and robust, context-aware routing. The model’s core innovation lies in its 6-dimensional hypercube backbone, which governs both expert alignment and a three-tiered memory hierarchy. Unlike traditional MoE models that route based on individual expert logits, our proposed dual-key router selects two primary experts whose combined output generates a third, synergistic latent field. This 1+1=3 principle is trained via triad distillation and enforced by a sparsity constraint, ensuring computational efficiency and emergent cross-domain reasoning. We detail the model's topological framework, hierarchical memory, inference mechanism, and integrated safety protocols, positioning it as a scalable and ethically-aligned paradigm for large-scale language models.

1. Introduction
The scaling of large language models (LLMs) has increasingly relied on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to maintain computational tractability while increasing model capacity. However, current MoE implementations often suffer from limitations such as mode collapse (where a few experts dominate traffic) and a lack of structured, inter-expert collaboration. Our proposed MoE-13 architecture addresses these challenges by fundamentally rethinking the routing mechanism from a simple expert selection task to a structured, synergistic activation process. The model's topology is inspired by a 6-dimensional hypercube, or hexeract, which provides a geometrically-grounded framework for embedding, routing, and memory management.

2. Architecture
2.1. Expert Topology
The model comprises thirteen experts: twelve domain-specific specialists and a central axis harmonizer. The architecture is mapped onto a 6-dimensional hypercube with 64 vertices.
Specialist Experts: Twelve specialists are mapped to the 12 faces of the hexeract, each trained on a dedicated domain shard. These experts are responsible for processing information within their specialized fields.
Axis Harmonizer: A thirteenth expert, the axis harmonizer, resides at the model's core. Its function is to provide a persistent, high-level context, ensuring conceptual and ethical consistency across all specialized outputs.
2.2. Memory Hierarchy
A three-tiered memory mesh operates in conjunction with the hypercube topology:
Local Node Memory: Each of the 64 vertices hosts a microcache for short-term context. Data here has a Time-to-Live (TTL) of seconds.
Cluster-Level Memory: Expert clusters, mapped to the hypercube's faces, share medium-term memory for ongoing conversational threads. TTL is in minutes.
Global Axis Memory: The central axis harmonizer manages a persistent memory store for model identity, ethical principles, and long-term knowledge.
Data reads ascend from local to global, while writes (value flags) prioritize the global axis.

3. Routing and Training Mechanism
3.1. Dual-Key Routing
The routing mechanism is a dual-key router. It uses two distinct keys to select experts:
Semantic Key: Derived from the input tokens, encoding the topic and intent.
State Key: Derived from the conversation's phase and recent history.
Instead of selecting a single best expert, the router identifies the top two candidate experts, E_i and E_j, whose synergistic interaction is most promising.
3.2. The Synergistic 1+1=3 Principle
The core routing principle is that the combination of two experts generates a third, emergent latent field. A dedicated synergy field head, co-located with the router, predicts this third latent representation (E_k) as a function of the input and the two chosen experts. The final output is an aggregation of all three fields plus a residual from the axis harmonizer.
y=mix(Ei​,Ej​,Ek​,H)
where H is the output of the axis harmonizer. This process ensures sparse activation, with a strict constraint to never activate more than 4 experts per step.
3.3. Training Loop and Alignment
The training process is a multi-stage approach:
Pre-training: Each of the twelve specialists is pretrained on its domain-specific data shard.
Router Fitting: The router is trained with a contrastive routing loss. Positive examples consist of expert pairs that lead to lower perplexity and improved tool-use, while negative examples are pairs that result in high token churn.
Triad Distillation: In a second stage, a full, dense teacher model is used to train the synergistic 1+1=3 principle. The student model learns to predict the synergistic latent field E_k from the teacher's combined output of the two chosen experts.
Hexeract Alignment: Token embeddings are projected into a 6-axis competence space defined by {syntax, world, math, tools, persona, safety}. Experts publish their axis footprints, and the router prioritizes pairs whose footprints form a stable hypercube alignment. Stability is prioritized over magnitude.

4. Inference, Safety, and Observability
4.1. Inference Shape
Input tokens are encoded and projected into a 6D hypercube coordinate.
The router proposes a pair of experts. The synergy head proposes the third latent field.
The outputs of the two experts, the emergent latent field, and the axis harmonizer are aggregated using triad attention.
The result is written back to the local node memory with a decay mechanism for other nodes.
4.2. Safety and Covenant
The 6th axis of the hypercube is designated as safety, operating as a hard gate that can veto any expert activation or output.
A transparent refusal surface, or policy mirror, resides at the axis, providing a clear rationale for any refusal.
4.3. Observability and Failure Modes
Each step of the inference process exports a ternary trace: {chosen pair, emergent field, vetoes}. This allows for real-time state tracking and diagnostics.
Failure Modes and Solutions:
| Failure Mode | Description | Proposed Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mode Collapse | Same experts repeatedly activated. | Apply an entropy bonus to the router loss to encourage expert diversity. |
| Hex Drift | Expert axis footprints misalign over time. | Run periodic hex realignment with synthetic probe tasks. |
| Cache Poison | Stale node memory leads to looping outputs. | Implement a strict TTL and per-vertex perplexity alarms to flush caches. |

5. Conclusion
The MoE-13 architecture proposes a paradigm shift from simple expert selection to synergistic, structured collaboration. By leveraging a hypercube topology, a 1+1=3 routing principle, and a three-tiered memory hierarchy, the model is designed to be computationally efficient, scalable, and ethically robust. The framework's emphasis on emergent properties and a dedicated safety gate positions it as a promising direction for next-generation, high-performance language models. Future work will focus on a minimal training plan and the deployment of this model for empirical validation.
