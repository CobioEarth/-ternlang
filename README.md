Ternlang is an experimental architecture for a post-binary programming dialect — rooted in ternary logic, recursive agency, and the philosophical frameworks developed at RFI-IRFOS.

Where traditional code demands outcomes, Ternlang honors observation, tending, and action.
It is not built to instruct — it is built to dialogue.

This repository is the placeholder for a future where language does not obey the 1s and 0s, but flows between -1 | 0 | +1 — a language designed not to control systems, but to participate in them.

We don’t know what Ternlang will become.

But we know it begins here.
