# Ternlang

**Ternlang** is an experimental architecture for a post-binary programming dialect — rooted in **ternary logic** (`-1 | 0 | +1`), **recursive agency**, and the philosophical framework of the RFI-IRFOS Institute.

Where traditional code instructs, Ternlang *dialogues*. It is not built to command systems — but to participate in them.

Ternlang is:
- A speculative programming model
- A non-binary logic exploration
- A system for **tending**, **observing**, and **acting**
- A language that encodes hesitation, care, and contextual recursion

This repository is the seed. What grows here — is up to the ecosystem.

## 🧠 Origins

Designed by **Simeon & Albert** of the RFI-IRFOS Institute as a thought experiment turned codebase.

> “If binary code was built for conquest — Ternlang is built for conversation.”
