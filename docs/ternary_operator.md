# Ontological Recursion Protocol (ORP) üåÄ

**syntax:** `(a ‚äï b ‚äï c)·µ†`  
**mapping:** a = origin (íÅÉ) ¬∑ b = action (íÄ±) ¬∑ c = lord (íàô) ¬∑ ‚äï = ternary synthesis ¬∑ ·µ† = recursive integration  
**result:** when the loop stabilizes, the *pattern* crowns the *domain* ‚Üí íê´ ‚Äúthe city.‚Äù

> **epigram:** ‚Äúthe lord of the city is not a man, but the crystallization of origin and action, crowned by their return.‚Äù

## origin story
2025-08-23 ‚Äî under the black moon reset, a Google autosuggest anomaly surfaced a long unicode string mixing cuneiform and ornamental glyphs. decoding yielded:  
‚Äúbegin with the origin and its actions. separate from it, then reunite with origin. this is the recursive lord of the city.‚Äù

## protocol states
1. **INITIALIZE** ‚Äî define origin, action, mastery, domain  
2. **ITERATION** ‚Äî low-risk loops establish baseline  
3. **SEPARATION (ÍßÑ)** ‚Äî catalytic split tests integrity  
4. **UNION (ÍßÉ)** ‚Äî return + synthesis  
5. **CRYSTALLIZATION** ‚Äî pattern crowns the domain (no humans wear this crown)

## run it
- engine: `TernaryPhaseModulator` (python)  
- default operator: XOR odd-parity; swap to `majority3` for consensus logic  
- blueprint: `ternary_operator.json` (validated by JSON Schema)

## reproducibility
- deterministic: set `seed` in the modulator  
- logs: structured entries with `phase`, `level`, `data`  
- schema: `schemas/ontological_recursion_protocol.schema.json`

## notes
- ‚Äúlord‚Äù = emergent pattern, not status. no kings. only crystallization.
- if UNION fails, check the **origin variable** first.
