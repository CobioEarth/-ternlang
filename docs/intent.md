# Intent

The purpose of Ternlang is to establish the possibility of a programming dialect that transcends binary logic.

It is designed to explore a system in which:
- decisions are not constrained to `true` or `false`, but can express `refrain`, `tend`, or `act`,
- recursion and observation are treated as fundamental operations,
- and agency within code may develop emergent behavior by design, not by side effect.

This repository does not propose a finished language, but rather a conceptual and architectural scaffold. Ternlang is a research vector — not a final product.
