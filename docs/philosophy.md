# Foundational Framework

Ternlang is motivated by the following premises:

1. **Computational logic need not remain binary.**  
   Many real-world phenomena, especially those involving cognition, social dynamics, or ethics, require a logic system that allows for inaction, ambiguity, or observation without conclusion.

2. **Agency requires recursion.**  
   The capacity to modify behavior based on self-monitoring is essential for adaptive, reflective systems. Ternlang treats recursion as first-order.

3. **Not all code should produce an outcome.**  
   In certain systems, the most appropriate action is no action. Encoding *refrain* as a computational outcome is central to this philosophy.

Ternlang does not seek to replace existing paradigms, but to expand the space of what programmable systems may express.
