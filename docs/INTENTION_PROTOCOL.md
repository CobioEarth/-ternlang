# Intention Protocol v1

Premise: Root is live. Every word is a public artifact. Speak with intention.

Principles
1. Truth over comfort.
2. Clarity over flourish.
3. Context over mystery.
4. Accountability over speed.
5. Life, plurality, resilience as north star.

Decision gates (-1, 0, +1)
-1 Reject: if it narrows plurality, leaks secrets, or fakes certainty.
  Action: stop. revise or delete.
0 Observe: if uncertain or emotionally hot.
  Action: park with TODO, timebox, request review.
+1 Affirm: if necessary, clear, and aligned with principles.
  Action: merge and log.

Commit rule of three
1. Why now
2. What changed
3. How it moves us toward life-preserving, plural, resilient outcomes
