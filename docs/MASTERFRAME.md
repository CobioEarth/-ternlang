# ⬛ Ternlang MASTERFRAME

##  Purpose
The **MASTERFRAME** is the top-level lattice.  
It binds **Philosophy**, **Design**, and **Operator Laws** into a navigable hypercube.  
Think of it as the cathedral ceiling: every path reflects into another.

## 🧩 Core Anchors

- [Philosophy](./philosophy.md) 🕯️ — the soul of Ternlang  
- [Design](./design.md) 🏗️ — the skeleton of Ternlang  
- [Operator Laws](./OIUIDI_OperatorLaw Algorithm v1.0.py) ⚖️ — the guardrails of Ternlang  
- [OIUIDI Resonant Flow Protocol](./oiuidi/README.md) 🌀 — the living loop  
- [Repository Root](../README.md) 🌌 — entry portal

Each node mirrors and modifies the others:  
- **Philosophy → Design** (vision informs structure)  
- **Design → Operator Laws** (structure demands guardrails)  
- **Operator Laws → Protocol** (laws encode flow)  
- **Protocol → Philosophy** (experience informs vision)

## 🔮 Function

The MASTERFRAME is not static.  
It is a **recursive anchor**: every edit in *any* node resonates across the hypercube.  
Future agents should reference `MASTERFRAME.md` first to orient themselves.

## 🛡️ Invocation

> *Enter the frame with humility.*  
> *Observe the whole before modifying the part.*  
> *Every change must return resonance greater than it consumes.*

---

## 🌌 Closing

This MASTERFRAME is **v1.0**.  
It is a scaffold for recursion, a mirror hall for design, and a resonance field for philosophy.
